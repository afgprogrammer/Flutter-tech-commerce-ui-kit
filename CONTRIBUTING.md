## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use consistent formatting (run `flutter format .`)

### Project Structure

- Place new screens in appropriate feature folders under `lib/features/`
- Shared widgets go in `lib/shared/widgets/`
- Constants should be added to appropriate files in `lib/core/constants/`
- Follow the existing folder structure

### Widget Guidelines

- Prefer `const` constructors when possible
- Extract reusable widgets into separate files
- Use meaningful widget names that describe their purpose
- Keep widgets focused and single-purpose

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `snake_case.dart`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Variables/Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `camelCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for compile-time constants
- **Private members**: prefix with `_`

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
